# coordinates is a good example of tuple, using parenthesis ()

# list = []
# tuples = ()

# tuple is "immutable" it can't be changed or modified
# however, you can make a list of tuples, but they can't be changed anyways.
# coordinates = [(4, 5), (6, 7), (80, 34)}

# most of the time its lists > tuples.
# tuples is good if you want to store data that cant be changed. 
coordinates = (4, 5)
print(coordinates)

# print individual entries in a tuple
print(coordinates[0])
print(coordinates[1])
