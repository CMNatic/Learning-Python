# we need to assign the following to a variable: a name e.g. character_name
# variables can contain: strings (text), numbers, boolean


character_name = "John"
character_age = "35"

# example boleean
is_male = True

print("There was an old man named " + character_name + ",")
print("he was " + character_age + " years old. ")

# Variables can be changed later-on in the code by simply changing the value
character_name = "Tom"

print("He really liked the name " + character_name + ",")
print("but didn't like being " + character_age + ".")
